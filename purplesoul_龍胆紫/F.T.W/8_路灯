路灯


从内个地方来到中国让传奇开始，
一个古老的传说改变了我的生活，
给了我一个启示和一个梦想，
于是我离开了我的家踏上了属于我自己的路途天上的星星指引着我的方向
恶劣的气候和环境
命中注定的阻挠和感情影响不了我的信念
祈祷在心中默念
保佑与诅咒谁能定是否
这个世界的开始时黑暗和混乱的
埋在地下的的宝藏永远闪耀着
所有人都不由自主的伸出了手
我看见真善忍假恶丑
谁是你的主人你是谁的奴隶
魔鬼与上帝的对话和游戏
隐藏的真理宇宙的秘密
不再需要科技
顺其自然的继续
末日来临的时候奇迹才会发生
为了你舍弃自己这叫牺牲
我的生命很短暂但不会安静
一个古老的故事我说给你听


在路上唯一的痛苦是孤独
但我清楚没有痛苦就没有进步
所以我从来不在乎付
因为这是属于人民的财富
为人民服务
不管是去天堂还是下地狱
为了创造证明神存在的证据
让勇敢占据我的心
战胜所有的恐惧让我和我的哥们儿继续
在这条路上唯一的痛苦是孤独
可我清楚没有痛苦就没有进步
所以我从来不在乎付出
因为这是属于人民的财富为人民服务
不管是去天堂还是下地狱
为了创造证明神存在的证据
让勇敢占据我的心
战胜所有的恐惧让我和我的哥们儿继续

The harsh climate, environment, and predetermined obstacles and emotions cannot dampen my faith.

Who is your master and who are you a slave to? A dialogue and game of the devil and God.

My life may be brief but it will not be silent, I have an old story to tell you.

The only pain on the road is loneliness, but I know that progress cannot be made without suffering.

Thus, I do not care about payment because this is the wealth of the people, and I serve the people.

不管是去天堂还是下地狱为了创造证明神存在的证据
Whether going to heaven or hell, I strive to create evidence that proves the existence of God.

让勇敢占据我的心战胜所有的恐惧让我和我的哥们儿继续
Let courage occupy my heart, and conquer all fears so that me and my buddies can keep going.
