### 就为了攀一眼
### 
### [Verse I: FAC-D12]
### 聚了散 散了又聚
### 这一路我绝逼没想到能走到现在这一步
### 那些本不该来的已经到站下车
### 你我 注定这一趟车赶不上一拨
### 真就像之前的哥哥跟我们说的
### 人会随着环境而改变 你说呢
### 在这座桥上 迷失的人太多了
### 看你身边在一块的哥们儿现在还多么
### 真实环境造就了每个不同的人
### 嘈杂的声音将生活与危险共存
### 尽管我们全都是来自同一个地方
### 想要的不一样导致了不一样的方向

### Fac D12 production ...
 
### [Verse II: JahJahWay]
### 又再一次到了 惩罚我的时刻
### 面对因果报应的时候 我还能怎么做
### 我不会跪着乞求我的神原谅我的错
### 我知道这是属于我的 我早就准备好了
### 经过大脑的话 能刺破心脏
### 活生生的各种疼 我得扛住了
### 只要我还活着这个麦克风就不是你的
### 不怕你火了 是不想看着你把自己给毁了
### 我站在 与世界沟通的桥上
### 看着人们每天不停的穿梭过往
### 努力的想去搭建一张张巧妙的网
### 却没有想到桥的尽头又是那一堵堵高墙
### 如果你真的能看见我看见的一切
### 我敢打赌你绝对不会想再多看一眼
### 我们混在最肮脏最低贱的地方
### 在这生的人不爱这儿也离不开这儿
### 我只能用说唱与你保持着距离
### 站在桥下点燃[cigs***??]维持着呼吸
### 我故意的留在这一直不往前走
### 因为我需要你明白然后和我一起
### 就算所有的努力 没有任何的意义
### 我也是心甘情愿的不会再去逃避
### 没有谁是离不开的 我的爱就在那儿
### 这是谁都躲不开的 因为恨还在这儿

----

### [Verse III: SouthsideSamurai]
### 瞅你那傻操性上边还得有人罩着
### 现在你笑了 还是得有你想不到的
### 决不让你吃亏 你妈逼你丫也是个废物
### 缺心眼儿的歇了逼的 我真 特别佩服
### 咱可互相交换着命 搭了一座桥
### 错综复杂立体交叉着的破鸡巴桥
### 玩艺术的傻屌们 挨饿的吃饱了装疯假思考
### 无所谓的受不了了
### 结了离了 又好
### 大佬与捧臭脚的
### 真是要多傻有多傻 要多好有好
### 越走越近 有出生就有衰老的
### 越来越远 别刚站起来又摔倒了
### 说了你也不信
### 忽冷忽热的忽隐忽现忽远忽近
### 大了小了快了慢了忽明忽暗
### 还是你想要折现
### 规矩为谁改变了 之前都不值钱了
### 可我一直在你前头是你没感觉到吗
### 谁为了谁的什么谁心里不知道
### 能在人的状态下恨不得戴俩乳罩
### 能在傻帽的House里面约好几炮
### 那些傻逼都盯着
### 你(一??? not sure)知道就惊了
### 让我放你一条生路 你先还我北京
### 教你最简单的方法把这时代看清楚
### 看你父母充满失望恐惧的眼睛
### ～～～～～～
### ～～～～～～
### ～～～～～～
### ......


== Overall Meaning ==

The lyrics to 龍胆紫's song "立交桥" paint a picture of a journey - one that has been full of twists and turns, separations and reunions. The narrator reflects that they never would have thought they would arrive where they are now. They remark on how some people who were not supposed to be a part of their journey have arrived at their destination, while others who were meant to be there have moved on. The song acknowledges that people change with their environment, and that being lost and confused on a bridge surrounded by danger is all too common.

The second verse delves deeper into the narrator's own struggles. They accept that they will face punishment for their past mistakes and karma, but they will not beg for forgiveness. They know they must face the consequences head-on and endure the pain. The lyrics go on to express that the narrator feels like they are stuck on the bridge, watching people passing by without really connecting with anyone. They acknowledge how hard everyone is working to build something but fail to realise that there is only despair beyond the end of the bridge. The final part of the song seems to be a call for people to understand their situation, to let go of hate and to accept love as the one thing that truly matters.

Overall, "立交桥" is a reflection on the journey of life, how it shapes us and how it can lead us to dark and confusing places. The lyrics express the importance of understanding and embracing love, even in the midst of despair and danger.
