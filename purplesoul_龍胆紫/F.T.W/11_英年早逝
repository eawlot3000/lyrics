英年早逝

从爱到伤害 变得这么快
从朋友到陌生人 变得这么快
我以为自己早已被这时代淘汰
结果没想到你们死得比我还快
放慢我的脚步和生活的节奏
你看我什么都没干 感觉我特别懒
我告诉你有些事真不能着急
深呼吸 放松 控制你的气
先思考 再行动 带着你的问题
你的答案让你知道现在谁说了算
敢不敢来挑战 拿走属于你自己的
如果你真的想赢 那你就真得豁命
没有永远的胜负 永远有人不服
永无休止的复仇藏在Flow的背后
灵感下意识的被你刺激 才发现
歌词里说的不是你而是我自己

你听 这是来自死神的召唤
在生命要结束的时候告诉你该怎么办
需要革命 不是跟这个时代
你该明白是为了更多人的将来
你的生命 给你一个身体
你的灵魂 就在你的眼睛里
你能看得见吗 能感觉得到吗
一颗年轻的心在为它的停止而跳着

我能感觉到死亡离我越来越近
现在时间不多了所以必须抓紧
年轻的生命 是你最宝贵的
可以改变一切 但是是有限的
此时此刻将变成再也回不去的过去
我必须更强壮才能改变我的命运
不规矩的规则压迫着我的生活
我只有继续反抗没有别的选择
人海淹没了渺茫的希望
贪婪摇晃着坚定的立场
我想 我不能说 因为我不知道
也没有人能告诉我 只有我自己去找
放下身上背的责任和所有牵挂
对不起 请原谅 是这样
总有那么一天 我不能再出发
谢谢你 请把我送回我永远的家

你听 这是来自死神的召唤
在生命要结束的时候告诉你该怎么办
需要革命 不是跟这个时代
你该明白是为了更多人的将来
你的生命 给你一个身体
你的灵魂 就在你的眼睛里
你能看得见吗 能感觉得到吗
一颗年轻的心在为它的停止而跳着

你的出生注定了你的死亡
从天真无邪到有自己的思想
在每个国家的政府控制的时代中被教育 被洗脑 被利用到老
再拿着养老保险退休金住进医院
这就是人生吗 我想说抱歉
于是我开始思考如何去改变
为了让年轻的生命一直到永远
这个世界很美也很残酷
所以我拿着一把枪和一本书
让这把枪保护我到书中的黄金屋
让我们一起分享它无限的财富
继续保持传统
追随着最原始最根源的那种感动
它一直在我心里
保护我 指引我
从来就没有离开过

你听 这是来自死神的召唤
在生命要结束的时候告诉你该怎么办
需要革命 不是跟这个时代
你该明白是为了更多人的将来
你的生命 给你一个身体
你的灵魂 就在你的眼睛里
你能看得见吗 能感觉得到吗
一颗年轻的心在为它的停止而跳着
