轮回


一九八九年五月五我出生
知道你却不敢面对的事情发生
属于我的自由也该属于这个世界
人民团结的力量像是黑色的夜
曙光来临爆发了问题摩擦
鬼都害怕了控制武器开始谋杀
最后活着的不敢替死去的人说话
最后没有答案 你又不得不习惯
这过程 就像你活着解决麻烦
分离或污染 人心泛滥发展
你所得到的往往超过了你想要的
没想到吧最后罪孽淹没了道德
政府掠杀每个民族的自尊心
军人欺负百姓 被狗吃了的良心
最后活着的不敢替死去的人说话
最后没有答案 活着就得习惯

脱离了痛苦的人们都去了那儿
齐步走向新的开始都去了那儿
现实里不现实的秘密都藏在那儿
为什么还总有人要赖在这儿
数不尽的荣华富贵都来自这儿
生老病死一直循环的被埋在这儿
刚刚得逞的人类准备统治谁
一旦轮回开始了就再轮回

当你遇见了梦里的地儿可你还醒着
幻想破灭的伤害忘不了的影子
你想无有止息的循环在天 人 阿修罗 畜生 饿鬼 地狱中的哪个角落
智慧反复着让许多生命无法解脱
生死凡夫 罪障深重
作善恶业分别生于三道
轮回于六道 我信了神能让我依靠
当你的国家不再保护你，一直剥削你，欺骗你
逼你自己想杀自己
谁在接收假的信号儿，还傻的冒泡儿
别人都在怀疑自己那也用不着你
每个时代都有你我这样的人
有人听说了惦记，有人保持精神
最后活着的不敢替死去的人说话
最后没有答案，活着就得习惯

[chorus]
脱离了痛苦的人们都去了那儿
齐步走向新的开始都去了那儿
现实里不现实的秘密都藏在那儿
为什么还总有人要赖在这儿
数不尽的荣华富贵都来自这儿
生老病死一直循环的被埋在这儿
刚刚得逞的人类准备统治谁
一旦轮回开始了就再轮回

请别忘了这个圈子最初的样子
一直扩大变换着关系生命出现
你看有赚的 骗的 明的暗的 玩儿玩儿算了
精的傻的 真的假的 偷了东西偷生的
看看你看得见的我身边的人
太多让我失望的节奏来自心脏
他妈的虚伪的价值杀了你好几遍
可贪生怕死的人们都想要去体验
瓷 请别为了现实而感到矛盾
刺穿又抵触着成熟，存在疑问
找到发展过程中，有相同的规律
我们顺着规矩看着他们自作自受地死
也无能为力 是自生自灭
生命生死相续 你不敢相信了吧
别指着人民替你说句实话
寻求紫色的答案灵魂马上习惯

[chorus]
脱离了痛苦的人们都去了那儿
齐步走向新的开始都去了那儿
现实里不现实的秘密都藏在那儿
为什么还总有人要赖在这儿

数不尽的荣华富贵都来自这儿
生老病死一直循环的被埋在这儿
刚刚得逞的人类准备统治谁
一旦轮回开始了就再轮回


脱离了痛苦的人们都去了那儿
齐步走向新的开始都去了那儿
现实里不现实的秘密都藏在那儿
为什么还总有人要赖在这儿

数不尽的荣华富贵都来自这儿
生老病死一直循环的被埋在这儿
刚刚得逞的人类准备统治谁
一旦轮回开始了就再轮回
