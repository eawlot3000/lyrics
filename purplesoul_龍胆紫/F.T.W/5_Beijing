Beijing Zoo



welcome to the BeiJing Zoo
这是我们的Hood 一直住 这条路
天天有人得混 天天都有人堵
天天有人想要摇一摇这颗树
但是这片大森林 真是不太好混
林子里边儿太阴 而且这水太深
所有的鲤鱼都想越过龙门
只有不甘浮沉 才能穿金戴银 哥们儿
我保证你能喜欢这个地儿
只要你能喜欢我们玩儿的这个味儿
别人再怎么学也就学个样儿
只有本土原装的才是这个范儿
雁过留声 人过留名
北京城 圆了多少人的北京梦
各路的精英在这儿涿鹿群雄
但最后 鹿死谁手 还真不一定

你想当座山雕还是不死鸟
想不想开大宝马坐捷豹
骨子里的本性是狼还是羊
有没有胆量正当万兽之王
你是千里马还是井底之蛙
是鱼还是虾你到底多大的耍
熊心豹子胆狮子大开口
我们癞蛤蟆就是想吃天鹅的肉

再次把你视线拉回到北京园儿
北范儿 混的尖儿全都扎在这儿
这地下埋着太多历代历朝的事儿
所以上边儿混的主儿 都带着一股劲儿
谁都不份儿 这感觉不用装
没办法在北京流浪就是这么长
我们能闻出来到底哪儿的肉更香
在家门口儿还轮不到外人儿来
这地方儿 看看到底谁玩儿的转
是公的 是母的 咱们战场上见
有模有样儿的这儿都快堆成山了
但只有一款能站在食物链的顶端
从黑子 维子 京油子 卫嘴子
浙皮子 东北的 高丽棒子 洋鬼子
天下的乌鸦一般黑
我的龙兄虎弟 才是虎胆龙威


你想当座山雕还是不死鸟
想不想开大宝马坐捷豹
骨子里的本性是狼还是羊
有没有胆量正当万兽之王
你是千里马还是井底之蛙
是鱼还是虾你到底多大的耍
熊心豹子胆狮子大开口
我们癞蛤蟆就是想吃天鹅的肉

welcome to the BeiJing Zoo
Welcome to Beijing Zoo

这是我们的Hood 一直住 这条路
This is our hood, we've always lived on this street

天天有人得混 天天都有人堵
Everyday someone has to struggle, everyday someone has to face obstacles

天天有人想要摇一摇这颗树
Everyday someone wants to shake this tree

但是这片大森林 真是不太好混
But this vast forest is really not easy to navigate

林子里边儿太阴 而且这水太深
The forest is too shaded and the water is too deep

所有的鲤鱼都想越过龙门
All carps aspire to jump the dragon gate

只有不甘浮沉 才能穿金戴银 哥们儿
Only those unwilling to sink can wear gold and silver, brother

我保证你能喜欢这个地儿
I guarantee you'll like this place

只要你能喜欢我们玩儿的这个味儿
As long as you can appreciate the way we play

别人再怎么学也就学个样儿
Others can only imitate

只有本土原装的才是这个范儿
Only the original local style is the right way to do it

雁过留声 人过留名
The sound of geese passing by leaves an echo, people passing by leave a name

北京城 圆了多少人的北京梦
How many people's dreams of Beijing have been fulfilled in this city

各路的精英在这儿涿鹿群雄
All kinds of elites gather here, competing with each other

但最后 鹿死谁手 还真不一定
But in the end, it's hard to say who will come out on top

你想当座山雕还是不死鸟
Do you want to be a mountain eagle or an immortal bird

想不想开大宝马坐捷豹
Do you want to drive a luxury car

骨子里的本性是狼还是羊
Is your inherent nature that of a wolf or a sheep

有没有胆量正当万兽之王
Do you have the courage to be the king of all creatures

你是千里马还是井底之蛙
Are you a thoroughbred or a frog in a well

是鱼还是虾你到底多大的耍
Are you a fish or a shrimp, what game are you playing

熊心豹子胆狮子大开口
A bear's heart and a leopard's bravery, a lion's roar

我们癞蛤蟆就是想吃天鹅的肉
We're just frogs who want to eat the meat of a swan

再次把你视线拉回到北京园儿
Let's bring your focus back to the Beijing Zoo

北范儿 混的尖儿全都扎在这儿
All the gangsters with style mingle here

这地下埋着太多历代历朝的事儿
This ground holds too much history from past dynasties

所以上边儿混的主儿 都带着一股劲儿
All the big players who make their mark here carry a certain momentum

谁都不份儿 这感觉不用装
Nobody puts on an act here, everyone is genuine

没办法在北京流浪就是这么长
If you're gonna wander around Beijing, prepare for a long journey

我们能闻出来到底哪儿的肉更香
We can tell which meat is the tastiest

在家门口儿还轮不到外人儿来
Even guests don't get to make decisions in our own home

这地方儿 看看到底谁玩儿的转
Let's see who can navigate this place the best

是公的 是母的 咱们战场上见
Male or female, we'll meet on the battlefield

有模有样儿的这儿都快堆成山了
There are too many imitators here

但只有一款能站在食物链的顶端
But only one stands at the top of the food chain

从黑子 维子 京油子 卫嘴子
From Blackie, Weaver, to the Ketchup boys and the Chicken Curry guys

浙皮子 东北的 高丽棒子 洋鬼子
From Hangzhou's leather jackets, to the Northeasterners, Koreans, and foreigners

天下的乌鸦一般黑
All the crows in the world are black

我的龙兄虎弟 才是虎胆龙威
My brothers of the dragon and the tiger are the epitome of bravery and power
