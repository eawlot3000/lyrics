== Overall Meaning == 

The lyrics to 龍胆紫's song 我不相信 (I Don't Believe) express the singer's disillusionment with society and the system, and their resolve to reject the lies and deceit propagated by those in power. The song begins with a call to arms against fraudsters, and a declaration of intent to pursue freedom, which the envious will try to take away. The singer is dissatisfied with having their rights taken away, and refuses to negotiate any more terms with those who have no shame. The lyrics take a critical view of the state of the capital, with the singer having to watch out not just for thieves, but also for hidden dangers like bombs. The streets are congested, and the altruistic ones cannot catch the criminals who continue to commit crimes.

The singer is aware of how manipulative the media can be, and recognizes that leadership is often nothing more than a facade. They are suspicious of any type of welfare, and questions whether the motives behind it are sound. The elites responsible for making such decisions often come up with bad ideas, and a trail of deception follows their actions. The singer detests how the establishment tries to silence their voice for fear of exposure. They do not believe in advertisements or jokes that lack reason. The singer feels that even milk powder is not devoid of danger, and that the pursuit of money and power has become a never-ending cycle.

In the last few lines of the song, the singer expresses their lack of faith in anyone, as everyone seems to have forgotten their emotions and abandoned time. The system and society have let them down, and the singer retreats once again to the underground, defiant in their stance that they do not believe in anything anymore.
