# 10 Forgot About Dre (Ft. Eminem)


-----

### [VERSE 1: DR. DRE]  
### Y'ALL KNOW ME, STILL THE SAME OG  
### BUT I BEEN LOW-KEY  
### HATED ON BY MOST THESE ~NIGGAS~  
### WITH NO CHEESE, NO DEALS AND NO G'S  
### NO WHEELS AND NO KEYS  
### NO BOATS, NO SNOWMOBILES, AND NO SKIS  
### MAD AT ME, 'CAUSE I CAN FINALLY AFFORD TO PROVIDE MY FAMILY WITH GROCERIES  
### GOT A CRIB WITH A STUDIO AND IT'S ALL FULL OF TRACKS  
### TO ADD TO THE WALL FULL OF PLAQUES  
### HANGIN' UP IN THE OFFICE AND BACK AT MY HOUSE LIKE TROPHIES  
### DID Y'ALL THINK I'MA LET MY DOUGH FREEZE? HOE, PLEASE  
### YOU BETTER BOW DOWN ON BOTH KNEES  
### WHO YOU THINK TAUGHT YOU TO SMOKE TREES?  
### WHO YOU THINK BROUGHT YOU THE OLDIES?  
### EAZY-E'S, ICE CUBE'S, AND D.O.C.'S  
### THE SNOOP D-O-DOUBLE-G'S  
### AND THE GROUP THAT SAID, "MOTHERFUCK THE POLICE!"  
### GAVE YOU A TAPE FULL OF DOPE BEATS  
### TO BUMP WHEN YOU STROLL THROUGH IN YOUR HOOD  
### AND WHEN YOUR ALBUM SALES WASN'T DOIN' TOO GOOD  
### WHO'S THE DOCTOR THEY TOLD YOU TO GO SEE?  
### Y'ALL BETTER LISTEN UP CLOSELY  
### ALL YOU ~NIGGAS~ THAT SAID THAT I TURNED POP OR THE FIRM FLOPPED  
### Y'ALL ARE THE REASON THAT DRE AIN'T BEEN GETTIN' NO SLEEP  
### SO FUCK Y'ALL, ALL OF Y'ALL!  
### IF Y'ALL DON'T LIKE ME, BLOW ME!  
### Y'ALL ARE GON' KEEP FUCKIN' AROUND WITH ME AND TURN ME BACK TO THE OLD ME  
### 
### [CHORUS: EMINEM]  
### NOWADAYS, EVERYBODY WANNA TALK LIKE THEY GOT SOMETHIN' TO SAY  
### BUT NOTHIN' COMES OUT WHEN THEY MOVE THEIR LIPS  
### JUST A BUNCH OF GIBBERISH  
### AND MOTHERFUCKERS ACT LIKE THEY FORGOT ABOUT DRE  
### NOWADAYS, EVERYBODY WANNA TALK LIKE THEY GOT SOMETHIN' TO SAY  
### BUT NOTHIN' COMES OUT WHEN THEY MOVE THEIR LIPS  
### JUST A BUNCH OF GIBBERISH  
### AND MOTHERFUCKERS ACT LIKE THEY FORGOT ABOUT DRE  
### 
### [VERSE 2: EMINEM]  
### SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO SOMEBODY YOU HATE (WHAT?)  
### OR ANYONE TRYNA BRING TROUBLE YOUR WAY?  
### WANNA RESOLVE THINGS IN A BLOODIER WAY? (YUP)  
### JUST STUDY A TAPE OF N.W.A  
### ONE DAY I WAS WALKIN' BY  
### WITH A WALKMAN ON, WHEN I CAUGHT A GUY  
### GAVE ME AN AWKWARD EYE ('CHU LOOKIN' AT?)  
### AND STRANGLED HIM UP IN THE PARKING LOT WITH HIS KARL KANI  
### I DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF IT'S DARK OR NOT  
### I'M HARDER THAN ME TRYNA PARK A DODGE  
### WHEN I'M DRUNK AS FUCK  
### RIGHT NEXT TO A HUMONGOUS TRUCK IN A TWO-CAR GARAGE  
### HOPPIN' OUT WITH TWO BROKEN LEGS TRYNA WALK IT OFF  
### FUCK YOU TOO, BITCH, CALL THE COPS  
### I'MA KILL YOU AND THEM LOUD-ASS MOTHERFUCKIN' BARKIN' DOGS  
### AND WHEN THE COPS CAME THROUGH  
### ME AND DRE STOOD NEXT TO A BURNT-DOWN HOUSE  
### WITH A CAN FULL OF GAS AND A HAND FULL OF MATCHES  
### AND STILL WEREN'T FOUND OUT (RIGHT HERE!)  
### SO FROM HERE ON OUT, IT'S THE CHRONIC II  
### STARTIN' TODAY AND TOMORROW'S ANEW  
### AND I'M STILL LOCO ENOUGH TO CHOKE YOU TO DEATH WITH A CHARLESTON CHEW  
### CHICKA-CHICKA-CHICKA SLIM SHADY  
### HOTTER THAN A SET OF TWIN BABIES  
### IN A MERCEDES BENZ WITH THE WINDOWS UP  
### WHEN THE TEMP GOES UP TO THE MID-80S  
### CALLIN' MEN LADIES  
### SORRY DOC, BUT I BEEN CRAZY  
### THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN SAVE ME  
### IT'S OKAY, GO WITH HIM, HAILIE (DADA?)  
### 
### [CHORUS: EMINEM]  
### NOWADAYS, EVERYBODY WANNA TALK LIKE THEY GOT SOMETHIN' TO SAY  
### BUT NOTHIN' COMES OUT WHEN THEY MOVE THEIR LIPS  
### JUST A BUNCH OF GIBBERISH  
### AND MOTHERFUCKERS ACT LIKE THEY FORGOT ABOUT DRE  
### NOWADAYS, EVERYBODY WANNA TALK LIKE THEY GOT SOMETHIN' TO SAY

### [VERSE 3: DR. DRE]  
### IF IT WAS UP TO ME, YOU MOTHERFUCKERS'D STOP  
### COMIN' UP TO ME WITH YOUR HANDS OUT  
### LOOKIN' UP TO ME LIKE YOU WANT SOMETHIN' FREE  
### WHEN MY LAST CD WAS OUT, YOU WASN'T BUMPIN' ME  
### BUT NOW THAT I GOT THIS LITTLE COMPANY  
### EVERYBODY WANNA COME TO ME  
### LIKE IT WAS SOME DISEASE, BUT YOU WON'T GET A CRUMB FROM ME  
### 'CAUSE I'M FROM THE STREETS OF C-COMPTON! (COMPTON!)  
### I TOLD 'EM ALL  
### ALL 'EM LITTLE GANGSTAS, WHO YOU THINK HELPED MOLD 'EM ALL?  
### NOW YOU WANNA RUN AROUND TALKIN' 'BOUT GUNS LIKE I AIN'T GOT NONE  
### WHAT, YOU THINK I SOLD 'EM ALL  
### 'CAUSE I STAY WELL OFF?  
### NOW ALL I GET IS HATE MAIL ALL DAY SAYIN' DRE FELL OFF  
### WHAT, 'CAUSE I BEEN IN THE LAB  
### WITH A PEN AND A PAD TRYIN' TO GET THIS DAMN LABEL OFF?  
### I AIN'T HAVIN' THAT  
### THIS IS THE MILLENNIUM OF AFTERMATH  
### IT AIN'T GON' BE NOTHIN' AFTER THAT  
### SO GIVE ME ONE MORE PLATINUM PLAQUE  
### AND FUCK RAP, YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK  
### SO WHERE'S ALL THE MAD RAPPERS AT?  
### IT'S LIKE A JUNGLE IN THIS HABITAT  
### BUT ALL YOU SAVAGE CATS KNOW THAT I WAS STRAPPED WITH GATS  
### WHILE YOU WERE CUDDLIN' A CABBAGE PATCH
