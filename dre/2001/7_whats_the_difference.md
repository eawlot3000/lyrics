----
### [INTRO: PHISH]  
### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU?  
### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU?  
### 
### [VERSE 1: DR. DRE]  
### BACK WHEN CUBE WAS ROLLIN' WITH LORENZO IN A BENZO  
### I WAS BANGIN' WITH A GANG OF INSTRUMENTALS  
### GOT THE PENS AND PENCILS, GOT DOWN TO BUSINESS  
### BUT SOMETIMES, THE BUSINESS END OF THIS SHIT CAN TURN YOUR FRIENDS AGAINST YOU  
### BUT YOU WAS A REAL ~NIGGA~, I COULD SENSE IT IN YOU  
### I STILL REMEMBER THE WINDOW OF THE CAR THAT YOU WENT THROUGH  
### THAT'S FUCKED UP, BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET THE SHIT WE BEEN THROUGH  
### AND I'MA DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO CONVINCE YOU  
### 'CAUSE YOU MY ~NIGGA~, DOC, AND EAZY, I'M STILL WIT' YOU  
### FUCK THE BEEF, ~NIGGA~, I MISS YOU, AND THAT'S JUST BEING REAL WIT' YOU  
### YOU SEE, THE TRUTH IS, EVERYBODY WANNA KNOW HOW CLOSE ME AND SNOOP IS  
### AND WHO I'M STILL COOL WITH  
### THEN, I GOT THESE FAKE-ASS ~NIGGAS~ I FIRST BLEW WITH  
### CLAIMIN' THEY NONVIOLENT, TALKIN' LIKE THEY— (DO NOT RESIST THE BEAT)  
### SPIT VENOM IN INTERVIEWS, SPEAKIN' ON REUNIONS  
### MOVE UNITS, THEN TALK SHIT, AND WE CAN DO THIS  
### UNTIL THEN, I AIN'T EVEN SPEAKIN' YOUR NAME  
### JUST KEEP MY NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH, AND WE CAN KEEP IT THE SAME, ~NIGGA~  
### IT AIN'T THAT I'M TOO BIG TO LISTEN TO THE RUMORS  
### IT'S JUST THAT I'M TOO DAMN BIG TO PAY ATTENTION TO 'EM  
### THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE  
### 
### [CHORUS: PHISH]  
### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU?  
### YOU TALK A GOOD ONE, BUT YOU DON'T DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO  
### I ACT ON WHAT I FEEL AND NEVER DEAL WITH EMOTIONS  
### I'M USED TO LIVIN' BIG-DOG-STYLE AND STRAIGHT COASTIN'  
### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU?  
### YOU TALK A GOOD ONE, BUT YOU DON'T DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO  
### I ACT ON WHAT I FEEL AND NEVER DEAL WITH EMOTIONS  
### I'M USED TO LIVIN' BIG-DOG-STYLE AND STRAIGHT COASTIN'  
### 
### [VERSE 2: XZIBIT]  
### YO, I STAY WITH IT, WHILE YOU TRY TO PERPETRATE, PLAY WITH IT  
### NEVER KNEW ABOUT THE NEXT LEVEL UNTIL DRE DID IT (YEAH)  
### I STAY COMMITTED WHILE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS BABYSITTED  
### I SMASH THE CRITICS LIKE A OVERHAND RIGHT FROM RIDDICK (YEAH)  
### COME AND GET IT, SHITTED ON VILLAINS BY THE MILLIONS  
### I BE CATCHIN' BITCHES WHILE BITCHES BE CATCHIN' FEELINGS  
### SO WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?  
### I POP BOTTLES AND HOT HOLLOW-POINTS AT EACH AND ALL OF YOU (COME ON!)  
### A HEARTLESS BASTARD, HIGH AND PLASTERED  
### MY STYLE IS LIKE THE REACTION FROM TOO MUCH ACID—NEVER COME DOWN!  
### PASS IT AROUND IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT  
### HANG HOLLYWOOD ~NIGGAS~ BY THEY SOUL TRAIN LAMINATES  
### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU? (WHAT?)  
### ABOUT FIVE BANK ACCOUNTS, THREE OUNCES, AND TWO VEHICLES  
### UNTIL MY DEATH, I'M BANGLADESH  
### I SUGGEST YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH 'TIL AIN'T NONE LEFT  
### YO, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE!  
### 
### [CHORUS: PHISH]  
### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU?  
### YOU TALK A GOOD ONE, BUT YOU DON'T DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO  
### I ACT ON WHAT I FEEL AND NEVER DEAL WITH EMOTIONS  
### I'M USED TO LIVIN' BIG-DOG-STYLE AND STRAIGHT COASTIN'  
### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU?  
### YOU TALK A GOOD ONE, BUT YOU DON'T DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO  
### I ACT ON WHAT I FEEL AND NEVER DEAL WITH EMOTIONS  
### I'M USED TO LIVIN' BIG-DOG-STYLE AND STRAIGHT COASTIN'  
### 
### [VERSE 3: EMINEM & DR. DRE]  
### A'IGHT, HOLD UP, HOLD UP!  
### STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE! I GOT SOMETHIN' TO SAY, DRE  
### I WANNA TELL YOU THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW WHILE THIS FUCKIN' WEED IS IN ME (WHAT THE FUCK?)  
### I DON'T KNOW IF I EVER TOLD YOU THIS  
### BUT I LOVE YOU, DOG, I GOT YOUR MOTHERFUCKIN' BACK (RIGHT), JUST KNOW THIS SHIT  
### SLIM, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED IT  
### BUT I'VE HAD YOUR BACK FROM DAY ONE, ~NIGGA~, LET'S BLOW THIS BITCH  
### I MEAN IT, DOG—YOU EVER NEED SOMEBODY OFFED: "WHOSE THROAT IS IT?"  
### WELL, IF YOU EVER KILL THAT KIM BITCH, I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE THE OCEAN IS  
### WELL, THAT'S COOL, AND I APPRECIATE THE OFFER  
### BUT IF I DO DECIDE TO REALLY MURDER MY DAUGHTER'S MAMA  
### I'MA SIT HER UP IN THE FRONT SEAT AND PUT SUNGLASSES ON HER  
### AND CRUISE AROUND WITH HER FOR SEVEN HOURS THROUGH CALIFORNIA  
### AND HAVE HER WAVIN' AT PEOPLE (HI!)  
### THEN DROP HER OFF ON THE CORNER AT THE POLICE STATION  
### AND DRIVE OFF, HONKIN' THE HORN FOR HER (*BEEP-BEEP!*)  
### RAW-DOG, GET YOUR ARM GNAWED OFF  
### DROP THE SAWED-OFF AND BEAT YOU WITH THE PIECE IT WAS SAWED OFF OF  
### FUCK BLOOD, I WANNA SEE SOME LUNGS COUGHED UP  
### GET SHOT UP IN THE HOT TUB 'TIL THE BUBBLES POP UP  
### IN THEY NOSE AND COUGH SNOT UP, MUCUS AND HOT WATER  
### THAT'S FOR TRYNNA TALK LIKE THE CHRONIC WAS LOST PRODUCT  
### THAT'S FOR EVEN THINKIN' OF HAVIN' THEM THOUGHTS THOUGHT UP  
### AND YOU BETTER SHOW SOME RESPECT WHENEVER THE DOC'S BROUGHT UP  
### SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US? WE CAN START AT THE PENIS  
### OR WE CAN SCREAM, "I JUST DON'T GIVE A FUCK!" AND SEE WHO MEANS IT  
### 
### [CHORUS: PHISH]  
### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU?  
### YOU TALK A GOOD ONE, BUT YOU DON'T DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO  
### I ACT ON WHAT I FEEL AND NEVER DEAL WITH EMOTIONS  
### I'M USED TO LIVIN' BIG-DOG-STYLE AND STRAIGHT COASTIN'  
### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU?  
### YOU TALK A GOOD ONE, BUT YOU DON'T DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO  
### I ACT ON WHAT I FEEL AND NEVER DEAL WITH EMOTIONS  
### I'M USED TO LIVIN' BIG-DOG-STYLE AND STRAIGHT COASTIN'  
### 
### [OUTRO: PHISH]  
### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND— (*GUNSHOT*)
