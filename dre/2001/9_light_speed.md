### [INTRO: DR. DRE & (GIRL)]  
### HEY... HEY, WHASSUP?  
### MY NAME IS DRE  
### CAN I BLAZE SOME CHRONIC WITCHU?  
### (~NIGGA~, WHAT? FO' SHO'!  
### ROLL THAT SHIT UP!)  
### HELL YEAH  
### 
### [VERSE 1: DR. DRE]  
### STILL ALWAYS INTO SOMETHING, HEART STILL IN COMPTON  
### THE COMP CAN'T OPPOSE, DOPE CALI PLATINUM CLASSICALS  
### INTRODUCED YOU TO MY DOGGS, THAT DON'T LOVE HOES  
### AND FIRM FIASCOSâ€”ASSHOLES  
### FUCKED YOU UP WITH MY LAST VIDEO, TUXED UP  
### DOING A TANGO  
### AND CASH, ALWAYS IN MY GRASP  
### CAME UP IN THE GAME WEARIN' KHAKIS NOT KANGOLS, STRANGLIN' HOES  
### WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT IN MOST INTERVIEWS I JUST LAUGH  
### NOW I VACATE WITH HOES WITH A GANG OF ASS  
### ONE FEEDIN' ME MANGOES, THE OTHER LIGHTIN' MY HASH  
### RAP TABLOIDS WRITE DRE'S LIGHT IN THE ASS (WHAT?)  
### CAME HOME UPTIGHT, READY TO MASH  
### LIKE A GAS PEDAL, GET ON THAT '64 CHEVY LEVEL  
### AK-47 HEAVY METAL  
### WHO SAY DRE AIN'T GHETTO? JUST WHISTLE LIKE A TEA KETTLE  
### I THROW THREE AT YOU, TELL ME IF YOU SEE DEVILS  
### 'CAUSE WE REBELS OVER HERE, I SMELL CHRONIC IN THE AIR  
### THAT MEANS WE TAKIN' OVER THIS YEAR  
### YOU HEAR?  
### 
### [BRIDGE: GIRL, KRS-ONE & DR. DRE]  
### CHRONIC, 2000  
### "ONE!"  
### THAT MEANS WE TAKIN' OVER THIS YEAR, YA HEAR?  
### 
### [CHORUS: MS. ROQ & KNOC-TURN'AL]  
### LIGHT SPEED, BLAZIN' CHRONIC THROUGH THE GALAXY  
### HYDRO, DOJA, CHOCOLATE THAI WEED  
### OR WE MIGHT BE SIPPIN' ON GIN OR HENNESSEY  
### FUCK THAT, WHERE THAT NEW SHIT, THE CHRONIC ICED TEAS?  
### 
### [VERSE 2: HITTMAN]  
### I HANG AMONG HUSTLERS, THAT SLANG AND HOO-BANG BRONSON  
### WHEN BUZTAZ ROLL THROUGH, CAN'T FUCK WITH MY BOLD CREW  
### WE WILL HOLD YOU CAPTIVE AND BUST  
### 'CAUSE GANGBANGIN' IS THE ACTIVE, ACTIVITY  
### WHERE I BE LIVIN', B, THERE AIN'T NO LIBERTY STATUE  
### HOPE YOU GOT YOUR GAT, DON'T LET THEM CATCH YOU  
### SLIPPIN', WITHOUT YOURS, IT'S WARFARE OUTDOORS  
### AMBULANCE, VIOLENT UPROARS  
### TRASH ~NIGGAS~ TAKEN OUT LIKE CHORES  
### I MEET WHORES ON TOURS  
### JEANIE'S HOT AS PEPPER SO I SIP, CHAMPAGNE ON STORMY SHORES  
### B ON SOME HARDCORE, PORNOGRAPHIC  
### TOTING AUSTRIAN FIREARMS THAT'S MADE OUT OF PLASTIC  
### IN THESE DRASTIC SURROUNDINGS, IT BE SOUNDING LIKE LEBANON  
### MAKIN' FOOLS "RETREAT!" LIKE MEGATRON AND STARSCREAM  
### OH YEAH I SCREAM ON STARS  
### THAT GET LOOT THEN CROSSOVER LIKE KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR  
### GET OUT YOUR CAR SON, THAT'S HOW I CAME TO BOUGIE ~NIGGAS~  
### AT BAR ONE, IT'S EITHER THAT OR MAKE FRONT PAGE STARDOM  
### I'M THE GOLDEN CHILD, CHASED BY SARDO NUMPSAY  
### BUT GOD'S MY BULLETPROOF, IT'S HARD TO SHOOT ME, YOU HEAR?  
### BY THE TIME YOU SEE HIM *TWO GUN SHOTS*  
### THAT MEANS IT'S REAL FUCKIN' HARD TO SHOOT ME, YOU HEAR?  
### 
### [CHORUS: MS. ROQ & KNOC-TURN'AL]  
### LIGHT SPEED, BLAZIN' CHRONIC THROUGH THE GALAXY  
### HYDRO, DOJA, CHOCOLATE THAI WEED  
### OR WE MIGHT BE SIPPIN' ON GIN OR HENNESSEY  
### FUCK THAT, WHERE THAT NEW SHIT, THE CHRONIC ICED TEAS?
