dead capital - dirty moss

[verse 1]
把我圈在其中，根本不能放松
消磨人的意志，对时间产生同样预知差点儿失去意识
被抑制的想法懂得表达一致
我生长的城市，全是新建好的遗址
旗帜迎风飘扬特别鲜艳
墙垒得那么严，知识停在表面
人都贱，操！想走捷径所以开始骗
看一波儿接一波儿的孩子一遍又一遍
您定的条条框框在你破坏规矩之后
人民武警镇压人民，交税养疯狗
加入是真心拥护，还是有利可图？
投票，就从没见过会有人说不

[chorus x1]
没法认同这些谎言为人民服务
不想让我子孙，为你无知付出
在我年轻的时候抓紧时间领悟
可别走的时候身上没有我的财富
[x2]
没法认同这些谎言为人民服务
不想让我子孙，为你无知付出
在我年轻的时候抓紧时间领悟
可别走的时候身上没有我的财富

[verse 2]
是谁定义安全？杀了我的自由
受你保护的地方藏污纳垢
视而不见的不公，是为了养个废物
戴口罩之前先记得保护，别让脑子中毒
他们给你假设一个，你生活的结构
把你放进温水用你的肉，给自己垫厚
他们给自己，盖了数不清的高楼
等你送来你的积蓄，从现在到以后
从此这里只有更多的利益聚集
下一代的心理本能地开始攀比
每年开的会能解决百姓多少问题
限行换来多少空气，现在我问你

[chorus x1]
没法认同谎言为人民服务
不想让我子孙，为你无知付出
在我年轻的时候抓紧时间领悟
可别走的时候身上没有我的财富
[x2]
没法认同这些谎言为人民服务
不想让我子孙，被你无知付出
在我年轻的时候抓紧时间领悟
可别走的时候身上没有我的财富

[verse 3]
学校操场安的灯从来不开
城楼上的头像亮的能够穿透雾霾
领导们的孩子都在国外随便胡来
不用担心新的圈钱政策马上出台
在这繁荣背后又有多少人被牺牲？
穿军装的演员胸前挂满勋章
楼下老人打过仗，被这太平盛世遗忘
内部消费的场所老板喝的踉踉跄跄
看看你把自己包装地如此严密
大会堂里的特供食品挑选都很精细
被迫的现实继续假装糊涂
就算无法改变，至少做到心里看得清楚

[chorus x1]
没法认同这些谎言为人民服务
不想让我子孙，被你无知付出
在我年轻的时候抓紧时间领悟
可别走的时候身上没有我的财富
[x2]
没法认同这些谎言为人民服务，
不想让我子孙，被你无知付出。
在我年轻的时候抓紧时间领悟
可别走的时候身上没有我的财富
我的财富，我的财富，属于我的财富不想全都死在首都。
我的财富，我的财富，属于我的财富不想全都死在首都。
uhh —
