作词: Dirty Moss
Prod. by Jinsfake
应该怎么形容现实的梦里体验
错过的瞬间突然上头让人尽快发现
一年有多少天一辈子做自己多长时间
有人宣布资源有限有人有权优先
总感觉烦躁 在这儿就躲不掉
去你妈的反正不是我容忍了乱套
谁敢拍着胸脯保证没被扣上脚镣
我说真不是为了钱你觉得太可笑
寻找安全感的原因他妈不是因为安全
不就那点逼事儿么操吃喝拉撒卷
喝的水 吃的药 编的教材 修的桥
红旗万世不倒 我不能质疑多少
需要付出什么代价才会活得放心
同情狗的同时当心别玩成吕洞宾
勒住脖子系在胳膊其实性质都一样
穿着西装开大会的不是黑帮就是党
有了对比 就不太好办
一个死的循环 样子不太好看
可以再久一点儿并不着急靠岸
为什么苏醒的只有坏的习惯
有了对比 就不太好办
一个死的循环 样子不太好看
可以再久一点儿并不着急靠岸
逐渐接触人类我就越爱我的狗
准时统一的画面逼我看着感觉有点丑
口号里的废话往我脑子里边使劲儿扎
说实话的罪过比他妈杀人放火还要大
牢记哪个使命实现伟大民族复兴
握紧权柄听着就像阿拉伯人圣经
承诺总在需要兑现的时刻失灵
义愤填膺的眼睛都在现实世界失明
我想把所有洗脑的标语全部覆盖
让假民主真封建的受益者们倒台
我想真实的媒体被允许存在
而不是做个喉舌再将不堪掩埋
你看我们自己有多健忘
无神论的中央却在标榜自己是种信仰
谁打了胜仗想攥住我的心脏
合法使用暴力的不是黑帮只有党
有了对比就不太好办
一个死的循环样子不太好看
可以再久一点儿并不着急靠岸
为什么苏醒的只有坏的习惯
有了对比就不太好办
一个死的循环样子不太好看
可以再久一点儿并不着急靠岸
为什么苏醒的只有坏的习惯

应该怎么形容现实的梦里体验
What words can describe the experience of a dream within reality?

错过的瞬间突然上头让人尽快发现
Suddenly realizing the moments missed and trying to catch up as quickly as possible

一年有多少天一辈子做自己多长时间
How many days in a year, and how much time in a lifetime to be oneself?

有人宣布资源有限有人有权优先
Some declare limited resources, while others prioritize based on power

总感觉烦躁 在这儿就躲不掉
Feeling constantly irritated, unable to escape it here

去你妈的反正不是我容忍了乱套
Screw this chaos, I won't tolerate it anymore

谁敢拍着胸脯保证没被扣上脚镣
Who dares to guarantee they won't be shackled?

我说真不是为了钱你觉得太可笑
I'm not doing this for the money, you find that ridiculous

寻找安全感的原因他妈不是因为安全
The reasons for seeking security is not really about safety

不就那点逼事儿么操吃喝拉撒卷
Isn't it all just trivial bullshit about eating, drinking, shitting, and sleeping?

喝的水 吃的药 编的教材 修的桥
The water we drink, the medicine we take, the textbooks we learn from, and the bridges we cross

红旗万世不倒 我不能质疑多少
The red flag never falls; I cannot question it much

需要付出什么代价才会活得放心
What price must be paid to live without worry?

同情狗的同时当心别玩成吕洞宾
Be careful not to become like Lu Dongbin while sympathizing with dogs

勒住脖子系在胳膊其实性质都一样
The nature is the same, whether choking or tying around the arm

穿着西装开大会的不是黑帮就是党
Those in suits at meetings are either mafia or politicians

逐渐接触人类我就越爱我的狗
The more I interact with humans, the more I love my dog

准时统一的画面逼我看着感觉有点丑
The uniformly-timed images force me to stare, feeling a bit ugly

口号里的废话往我脑子里边使劲儿扎
The slogans shove meaningless words into my mind

说实话的罪过比他妈杀人放火还要大
Honestly speaking has a greater fault than murder or arson

牢记哪个使命实现伟大民族复兴
Remembering the mission of achieving a great national rejuvenation

握紧权柄听着就像阿拉伯人圣经
Clutching power is like listening to the Quran for Arabians

承诺总在需要兑现的时刻失灵
Promises falter when it's time to deliver

义愤填膺的眼睛都在现实世界失明
Eyes filled with righteous indignation are blind to the real world

我想把所有洗脑的标语全部覆盖
I want to cover up all the brainwashing slogans

让假民主真封建的受益者们倒台
Let the beneficiaries of fake democracy and true feudalism be overthrown

我想真实的媒体被允许存在
I want the real media to be allowed to exist

而不是做个喉舌再将不堪掩埋
And not just be a mouthpiece to bury the unworthy

你看我们自己有多健忘
See how forgetful we are ourselves

无神论的中央却在标榜自己是种信仰
The atheistic center is touting itself as a kind of faith

谁打了胜仗想攥住我的心脏
Whoever wins the war wants to grasp my heart

合法使用暴力的不是黑帮只有党
Legalized violence is not just for the mafia, but also for the party

为什么苏醒的只有坏的习惯
Why do only bad habits awaken?

有了对比就不太好办
It's hard when there's a contrast

一个死的循环 样子不太好看
A dead cycle, not a pretty sight

可以再久一点儿并不着急靠岸
No rush to reach the shore, can linger a bit longer
