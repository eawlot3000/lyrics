钢币


别不服从醒到灭永远传着呼
觉醒灵魂之后上路手里攥着书
态度特殊用最原始的方式阐述
do we want to do nigga杀了哪群蠢猪
我不是做hiphop我活的hiphop
我正在经历传奇请你少犯傻逼
关了你的Wi-Fi有想法儿了过来拔一代
家里呆不住了所以喜欢混在户外
MC等工资班儿逼镜头前的G
到了现场怎么看不见了你的凶器
研究造型的时候我在店里diggin
没心思社会交际natural doc boom da beat
遍地的街头品牌让人眼花缭乱
山寨太残只穿hoodie timberland
不听说唱的商人在利用它吃饭
所以为什么hiphop在中国越火越烂

口袋儿里的钢镚儿叮叮当当
我们都爱自由freeman不需要保障
逛在街上跟着节奏摇摇晃晃
make music fuck bullshit half a blunt

孩子吹牛逼说干了不少违法的事儿
却能在警局里拿样儿给PoPo写歌儿
他妈DJ不会搓会开手机直播
AK47揣怀里也没他妈看你丫开火儿？
参加选秀的视频也好意思发
要弄死这个内个，你作业写完了么
听过你的词儿假大空太多
没经历过险恶就别装大哥
你在你的hood被高中生切钱
还敢说你丫represent真他吗不要脸
关于爱情 操 留给软蛋去写
装逼偶像你最擅长都是娘娘腔
别那么娼给你妈逼里插根儿香
算算你活跃的时间还能有多长
dirtymoss忍不住总说的这么脏
告诉你比我疯的身后站着一大帮

口袋儿里的钢镚儿叮叮当当
我们都爱自由freeman不需要保障
逛在街上跟着节奏摇摇晃晃
make music fuck bullshit half a blunt



----
别不服从醒到灭永远传着呼
Don't resist and just wake up to spread the message forever

觉醒灵魂之后上路手里攥着书
After awakening my soul, I hit the road with a book in my hand

态度特殊用最原始的方式阐述
I express my attitude in a unique way using the most primitive means

do we want to do nigga杀了哪群蠢猪
Do we really want to kill a bunch of stupid pigs, nigga?

我不是做hiphop我活的hiphop
I don't just create hip-hop, I live hip-hop

我正在经历传奇请你少犯傻逼
I am living a legendary experience, so don't act foolish

关了你的Wi-Fi有想法儿了过来拔一代
Turn off your Wi-Fi, come up with some ideas and pull out the next generation

家里呆不住了所以喜欢混在户外
I can't stay at home, that's why I like to hang out outdoors

MC等工资班儿逼镜头前的G
MCs wait for their paychecks, but act tough in front of the camera

到了现场怎么看不见了你的凶器
When you're at the scene, why can't I see your weapon?

研究造型的时候我在店里diggin
When I'm studying style, I'm digging in the store

没心思社会交际natural doc boom da beat
I don't have the time for socializing, just the natural doc boom da beat

遍地的街头品牌让人眼花缭乱
The countless street brands make people dazzled

山寨太残只穿hoodie timberland
Imitation is too ugly, just wear hoodies and Timberlands

不听说唱的商人在利用它吃饭
Non-hip-hop merchants are using it as a meal ticket

所以为什么hiphop在中国越火越烂
That's why hip-hop is getting bigger but worse in China

口袋儿里的钢镚儿叮叮当当
The coins are jingling in my pocket

我们都爱自由freeman不需要保障
We all love freedom, freeman doesn't need protection

逛在街上跟着节奏摇摇晃晃
Strolling down the street swaying to the rhythm

make music fuck bullshit half a blunt
Making music, fuck bullshit, with half a blunt

孩子吹牛逼说干了不少违法的事儿
The kid brags about doing illegal things

却能在警局里拿样儿给PoPo写歌儿
But he can write songs for PoPo at the police station

他妈DJ不会搓会开手机直播
His DJ doesn't know how to mix, but can live stream on his phone

AK47揣怀里也没他妈看你丫开火儿？
You've got an AK47 but do you have the balls to use it?

参加选秀的视频也好意思发
You have the nerve to post your audition video?

要弄死这个内个，你作业写完了么
To kill that guy, did you finish your homework?

听过你的词儿假大空太多
I've heard your fake and empty lyrics too many times

没经历过险恶就别装大哥
If you haven't experienced danger, don't act tough

你在你的hood被高中生切钱
You got robbed in your hood by high schoolers

还敢说你丫represent真他吗不要脸
And you have the nerve to say you represent? You're shameless

关于爱情 操 留给软蛋去写
As for love, fuck it, let the weaklings write about it

装逼偶像你最擅长都是娘娘腔
Your expertise is trying to be cool, but it's all feminine

别那么娼给你妈逼里插根儿香
Don't be such a whore, can't you stick some perfume up your mom's vagina?

算算你活跃的时间还能有多长
Calculate how long you can stay active

dirtymoss忍不住总说的这么脏
Dirtymoss can't help but speak so dirty

告诉你比我疯的身后站着一大帮
I'll tell you, behind me there's a bunch of people crazier than me
