自然因子

心跳加快自然因子作怪
力量低调存在追住错开内半拍
嵌入灵魂的钥匙解释不可言的故事
静止的仪式凝固知觉频率一致

我醒来是为了晕排除熬夜的细菌
住的高能看见云远离人群
体会过了直来直去很容易的燥
接着往里找抓住最契合的需要
不一样的模样看起来相似的形状
总像是没充满电量半听儿汽水儿手里逛荡
踏上边缘因为越往中心越挤
当局者迷所以站在远处看完整的命题
我们都是利用自己交换生存物资
没人能一路平安进退间要三思
脱离体制的黑名单上签了我的字
因此你我类似的只剩有生有死
熟悉的概念总和实际情况相反
为了意识到的人性还不算晚
运行中的期盼把我使劲儿衬着
如果你也能感觉到它内个就是真的

心跳加快自然因子作怪
力量低调存在追住错开内半拍
嵌入灵魂的钥匙解释不可言的故事
静止的仪式 凝固知觉频率一致

You could run, but you can't hide forever
真的无所谓么绝望还是跟你挨着
叫上我的兄弟霸占丛林里的绿洲
看所有欲望奔走过后我们慢慢悠悠
不能变身奴隶然后再被分个层次
别曲解我的好意在遗憾之中放肆
有的时候冲动真的是剂良药
还有更刺激麻烦给我来个全套
想改变的朋友们反复计算风险
下决定之前安慰自己还有时间
喊出你的愿望首先请你组织语言
分清本能反应不用掩饰都听的见
我们乐意成为你定义的格格不入
快去乐园做个精灵我来当格格巫
在我的细胞里做实验打通未知元素
求不得聪明药只好以 毒 攻 毒

心跳加快自然因子作怪
力量低调存在追住错开内半拍
嵌入灵魂的钥匙解释不可言的故事
静止的仪式 凝固知觉频率一致
心跳加快自然因子作怪
The natural factors of a racing heartbeat are mischievously causing trouble.

力量低调存在追住错开内半拍
Strength exists quietly, pursuing and avoiding off-beat rhythms.

嵌入灵魂的钥匙解释不可言的故事
A key embedded in the soul tells a story that cannot be put into words.

静止的仪式凝固知觉频率一致
A still ceremony solidifies a unified perceptual frequency.

我醒来是为了晕排除熬夜的细菌
I wake up to clear the dizziness caused by staying up late, fighting off bacteria.

住的高能看见云远离人群
Living in a high energy home, I see clouds far away from the crowds.

体会过了直来直去很容易的燥
Having experienced the easy, straightforward way, I am easily irritated.

接着往里找抓住最契合的需要
Continuing to search within, I grasp the most fitting need.

不一样的模样看起来相似的形状
Different appearances that look like similar shapes.

总像是没充满电量半听儿汽水儿手里逛荡
It always feels like an unfinished soda, wandering around in my hand without being fully charged.

踏上边缘因为越往中心越挤
Stepping on the edge because the closer to the center, the more crowded it becomes.

当局者迷所以站在远处看完整的命题
As an observer, standing far away to see the entirety of the problem.

我们都是利用自己交换生存物资
We all use ourselves to exchange survival resources.

没人能一路平安进退间要三思
No one can completely stay out of harm's way, so caution is required in every decision.

脱离体制的黑名单上签了我的字
My name is written on the blacklist after leaving the system.

因此你我类似的只剩有生有死
Therefore, people like you and I are left with only life and death.

熟悉的概念总和实际情况相反
Familiar concepts always seem opposite to the actual situation.

为了意识到的人性还不算晚
It's not too late to acknowledge our own humanity.

运行中的期盼把我使劲儿衬着
The anticipation of running propels me to push harder.

如果你也能感觉到它内个就是真的
If you also feel that it's true, then it is.

真的无所谓么绝望还是跟你挨着
Does it really not matter if we're desperate or together?

叫上我的兄弟霸占丛林里的绿洲
Calling on my brothers to occupy the oasis in the jungle.

看所有欲望奔走过后我们慢慢悠悠
After chasing all desires, we slowly and leisurely move forward.

不能变身奴隶然后再被分个层次
We can't become slaves and then be divided into categories.

别曲解我的好意在遗憾之中放肆
Don't misinterpret my good intentions, being reckless in regret.

有的时候冲动真的是剂良药
Sometimes impulse is really a good medicine.

还有更刺激麻烦给我来个全套
There is even more excitement and trouble, so give me the full package.

想改变的朋友们反复计算风险
Friends who want to change continuously calculate the risks.

下决定之前安慰自己还有时间
Before making a decision, comforting oneself that there is still time.

喊出你的愿望首先请你组织语言
When shouting out your desires, first organize your words.

分清本能反应不用掩饰都听的见
Differentiate between instinctive reactions, no need to conceal, they are all audible.

我们乐意成为你定义的格格不入
We are willing to be the misfits you define.

快去乐园做个精灵我来当格格巫
Quickly go to the amusement park to become an elf, I will be the mischievous witch.

在我的细胞里做实验打通未知元素
Experimenting within my cells to unlock unknown elements.

求不得聪明药只好以 毒 攻 毒
Unable to obtain the smart drug, resorting to 'poison fighting poison.'

心跳加快自然因子作怪
The natural factors of a racing heartbeat are mischievously causing trouble.

力量低调存在追住错开内半拍
Strength exists quietly, pursuing and avoiding off-beat rhythms.

嵌入灵魂的钥匙解释不可言的故事
A key embedded in the soul tells a story that cannot be put into words.

静止的仪式 凝固知觉频率一致
A still ceremony solidifies a unified perceptual frequency.

== Overall Meaning ==

The lyrics of Dirty Moss's song 自然因子 speak of the enigmatic nature of life and the power of nature that can sometimes be beyond human comprehension. The opening line, "心跳加快自然因子作怪" (Heartbeat quickens, the workings of natural factors), sets the tone for the rest of the song, where the artist talks about the complex workings of the world we live in.

The song talks about the need to embrace change and to look for the things that truly matter in life. The lines "踏上边缘因为越往中心越挤, 当局者迷所以站在远处看完整的命题" (Stepping towards the edge, because the closer we get to the center, the more crowded it is.

The artist also explores the theme of self-discovery and the need to embrace our own uniqueness. The line "我们乐意成为你定义的格格不入" (We are willing to be the misfits as defined by you) acknowledges the pressure to conform that often exists in society, but challenges this by embracing individuality.
