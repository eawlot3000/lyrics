需要

需要的少多的是想得到
玩儿命的少多的是找依靠
我看看我的表，时间刚好
持续氛围制造这种感觉死不了

我们不相信惊喜能掌握自己
闹得风生水起不过如此而已
太多假痞真傻逼摆弄雕虫小技
这股乌烟瘴气不会把我灵魂蒙蔽
我们从采样儿来，到节奏里去
排列剪裁 用律动比喻
大脑控制身体真不可能亦步亦趋
扔掉那些虚荣燃烧从一开始的情绪
经常有人质疑我们不能这样活着
可现实就是我们还在扛着没想停过
无法妥协这火在我死之前就灭了
骗自己的日子抱歉我早就戒了
我的兄弟他们都和我是一种想法
不说废话作品里有清晰表达
是一卦凑一块儿就炸走哪儿都chua
没有办法 活着就不能没有boombap

需要的少多的是想得到
玩儿命的少多的是找依靠
我看看我的表，时间刚好
持续氛围制造这种感觉死不了

好坏的遭遇灵感不断
处理眼前的问题临危不乱
走马灯的转盘上面正在你追我赶
什么都不保险什么都没干完
幸好我没浪费阐述自我的能力
幸好我写歌儿的目的出张专辑
以后到底什么样待解之谜
至少现在做的肯定得对得起我自己
夜里兴奋找灵魂讨论
凌晨的指针我们几个不困
已然透支太深不必舔舐伤痕
一块儿混的心里清楚我们都是这种人
往前往后还能靠左靠右
贪婪大的可怕像是洪水猛兽
刺激只在瞬间拥有可它来了又走
节奏结构停留和生命环环相扣

需要的少多的是想得到
玩儿命的少多的是找依靠
我看看我的表，时间刚好
持续氛围制造这种感觉死不了

== Overall Meaning ==

The lyrics of Dirty Moss's song "需要" is a reflection on the desire for material possessions and the need for emotional support. The first verse talks about how people want things they don't need and how they neglect finding emotional connections. The narrator mentions that time is moving and, with the right atmosphere, they can create a feeling that will last forever. The chorus repeats that the things we need are often fewer than what we think we want, and that playing recklessly won't give us a sense of belonging.

The second verse reflects on the music industry and how it's all just a game. There are many fake people who try to impress others with their skills, but this doesn't obscure the narrator's soul. They come from a sampling background and move with the rhythms they create. The narrator asserts that they won't compromise their values of creating music that represents their innermost being, even if there are people who question their style of living. In the end, the song speaks to the fact that the desire for material possession will fade away, and that true connections are what make life worth living.
