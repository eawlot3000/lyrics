24/7

是什么让我夜里睡不着觉
流浪的野猫永远滴答的表
明天会不会有麻烦打扰
做好预料 盘算着始终不禁花的钞票
手指上的烟味儿还是洗不下去
开弓没有回头箭不用面面相觑
修饰伤害造句 我宁可闭门造车
安慰了自己满足多少人的私欲
陪陌生人笑看着身边亲人遭殃
只要我还能说唱就不会交枪
天开始亮请你有屁快放
跟音乐无关的事儿我从来不想
不掺烟丝 呼着也没感觉大
打了几个哈切喇叭循环放着hiphop
24个小时我的思想陪我一块儿
给我一个beats我用嘴巴给你画画儿

如果真的热爱24＊7
拍子从没断过hell to da heaven
从不安于现状again and again
all the city in the rain rollin paper in the green

谁和谁 互相帮助 发财致富
把血给止住愤怒成为我的支柱
冲向目标进步的我没忘记出处
你享受引人注目我全神贯注
在每个角落生长有营养的影响
到底几斤几两作品不会说谎
消费不完荒唐着急忙慌找谁开个光
可我只会带着耳机听最说的说唱
垃圾桶堆满打折的快餐
不断电的唱机上面有划痕的唱盘
无论环境多烂血液里的节奏不乱
选择正确飙着劲的没有时间偷懒
最好的年代 最坏的时代
缺的没被淘汰努力的总在失败
但是没关系我和我的瓷们都在
名利全都给你 the knowledge in my mind

如果真的热爱24＊7
拍子从没断过hell to da heaven
从不安于现状again and again
all the city in the rain rollin paper in the green

是什么让我夜里睡不着觉
流浪的野猫永远滴答的表
明天会不会有麻烦打扰
（做好预料）
盘算着不禁花也赚不完的钞票
（手指上的烟味儿还是洗不下去）
那我来继续 随便能多随便说真的（我不在意）
尊重我放在心里永远都不怕脏
谁还 逼你握着枪呢 （退后点儿别靠近）
这态度冷漠冷酷冷静的令人可怕
聪明的狐狸一着（急翘起了尾巴）
最肮脏的食物经过嘴和食道
甜蜜的梦加甜的微笑在
注意 刚一传到耳朵里（就明白意思）
天性放荡的人和钻进心里的句子
等换了这口气 又该面对面拥挤
还有谁想跟我比么



----
是什么让我夜里睡不着觉
What is keeping me up at night?

流浪的野猫永远滴答的表
A stray cat's ticking clock that never stops reminds me of passing time

明天会不会有麻烦打扰
Will troubles come and disturb me tomorrow?

做好预料 盘算着始终不禁花的钞票
Trying to budget my money which never seems to be enough

手指上的烟味儿还是洗不下去
The smell of smoke on my fingers won't go away

开弓没有回头箭不用面面相觑
Once a bow is drawn, there is no turning back and no need to hesitate

修饰伤害造句 我宁可闭门造车
I'd rather create my own art in isolation than use hurtful words for the sake of expression

安慰了自己满足多少人的私欲
Trying to fulfill the selfish desires of many has satisfied only myself

陪陌生人笑看着身边亲人遭殃
Laughing with strangers while watching my loved ones suffer

只要我还能说唱就不会交枪
As long as I can rap, I won't turn to violence

天开始亮请你有屁快放
As the day breaks, please let out any gas you may have

跟音乐无关的事儿我从来不想
I never want to think about anything unrelated to music

不掺烟丝 呼着也没感觉大
Even without tobacco, smoking doesn't make me feel much

打了几个哈切喇叭循环放着hiphop
Playing hip hop on repeat after scratching a few records

24个小时我的思想陪我一块儿
My thoughts accompany me 24/7

给我一个beats我用嘴巴给你画画儿
Give me a beat and I'll paint you something with my words

如果真的热爱24＊7
If you truly love something 24/7

拍子从没断过hell to da heaven
The rhythm never stops, from hell to heaven

从不安于现状again and again
Never content with my current state, again and again

all the city in the rain rollin paper in the green
In the rain, rolling paper filled with weed throughout the city

谁和谁 互相帮助 发财致富
Who helps who to make themselves rich

把血给止住愤怒成为我的支柱
Anger is my pillar, used to stop my own bleeding

冲向目标进步的我没忘记出处
As I progress towards my goal, I never forget where I came from

你享受引人注目我全神贯注
While you bask in the limelight, I stay focused and attentive

在每个角落生长有营养的影响
Growing in every corner, my influence brings nourishment

到底几斤几两作品不会说谎
My work speaks true, no matter how much it weighs

消费不完荒唐着急忙慌找谁开个光
When my spending gets out of hand, I frantically find someone to bail me out

可我只会带着耳机听最说的说唱
But I only listen to the most authentic rap with my headphones on

垃圾桶堆满打折的快餐
Garbage cans overflow with discounted fast food

不断电的唱机上面有划痕的唱盘
An ever-running turntable with scratched records on top

无论环境多烂血液里的节奏不乱
No matter how bad the environment, the rhythm in my blood remains unbroken

选择正确飙着劲的没有时间偷懒
Choosing the path of hard work leaves no time to slack off

最好的年代 最坏的时代
The best of times, the worst of times

缺的没被淘汰努力的总在失败
Those who lack have not been eliminated, but always fail despite their efforts

但是没关系我和我的瓷们都在
It's alright, me and my crew are still here

名利全都给你 the knowledge in my mind
Fame and fortune can be yours, but the knowledge in my mind is mine

那我来继续 随便能多随便说真的（我不在意）
Then let me continue, I can say whatever I want (I don't care)

尊重我放在心里永远都不怕脏
Respect me and I'll always be willing to get my hands dirty

谁还逼你握着枪呢（退后点儿别靠近）
Who's forcing you to hold a gun? (Move back, don't get closer)

这态度冷漠冷酷冷静的令人可怕
This cold, aloof, and calm demeanor is terrifying

聪明的狐狸一着（急翘起了尾巴）
Like a sly fox, making a quick move (lifting its tail)

最肮脏的食物经过嘴和食道
The dirtiest food passes through the mouth and throat

甜蜜的梦加甜的微笑在
Sweet dreams with sweet smiles

注意 刚一传到耳朵里（就明白意思）
Listen closely, and you'll understand the meaning as soon as it reaches your ear

天性放荡的人和钻进心里的句子
Promiscuous people and phrases that burrow into your heart

等换了这口气 又该面对面拥挤
Once this breath is out, I'll have to face the crowd all over again

还有谁想跟我比么
Who else wants to compete with me?
