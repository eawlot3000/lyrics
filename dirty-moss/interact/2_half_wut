半张烟票儿让你全身惊讶
half a blunt half amazing 的招式
word up!
操你的宣传人名儿比歌词都多
嘻哈歌手泛滥瞎叫唤没一个会说
半张烟票儿也能给你roll大，half a blunt没有别的这儿只有hiphop
操所有新花样儿我们选择扎在地下
好坏你心里明白谁也不用废话

铁打的吹牛逼配流水的MC
单曲都是专辑还有太多的MV
你推广的那么悬我听了也不飞
加了无数头衔问问自己到底配不配
帮派组的又多又花我一个没记住
你们丫给我的感觉就是一个字儿土
写着是hiphop我听都惊了因为是流行
娘炮儿音乐假逼儿玩意儿 妈的瞧你演内操行
用现成的loop做了一首歌儿
不负责任的歌词都是电影里的经过
玩儿旋律太蔫鼓敲的不够颠
想要得到粉丝关注我不听第二遍
粗制滥造都走起来你们丫的随便
half a blunt 一直保持水准制造音乐
真看不起风格多变每种都特缺
how many weak MC应该挨撅

半张烟票儿让你全身惊讶 half a blunt half amazing 的招式word up!
操你的宣传人名儿比歌词都多
嘻哈歌手泛滥瞎叫唤没一个会说
半张烟票儿也能给你roll大，half a blunt没有别的这儿只有hiphop
操所有新花样儿我们选择扎在地下
好坏你心里明白谁也不用废话

都活的挺有样儿哪儿来那么多的苦
别装逼了有内时间劝你多读读书
外强中干从你自己说的话中暴露
不会走就跑的大多背着偶像包袱
活动里不切歌儿的DJ我见过很多
嘴里全是drake lamar见面儿真无话可说
听说电子加嘻哈是新世代的风潮
half a blunt一直坚持留在老学校
无法阻止让傻逼疯狂流行
但我能够做到让自己的周围环境干净
不管又出了什么新的我们不会变
带你回到很久没再回去的街
做hiphop是好事儿但别光想着出名儿
真家伙来了内些假的都得除名儿
因为一直keep real 所以这么狂
记住我们是谁what what Half a blunt
