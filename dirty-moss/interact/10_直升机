直升机

dirty moss reconnect fade em all
你也能感觉的到所以fake fuck off
停不了 烈酒就着药神魂颠倒
节奏依旧粗糙麦克风早已出鞘
我们方式简单也清楚你的算盘
聊天儿爱装社会只好祝你平安
冷眼旁观废物点心蹦的那么欢
尊重有实力的其他去你妈我不惯
谁正走起来他妈给我都起开
管你丫是几几拍北京nigga 五五开
we smoke my life 没琢磨 该不该
真不听你犯傻逼Boom biddy bye bye
快结束的根儿再一次烫了嘴唇儿
betas勾着魂儿发动嘴巴里的齿轮儿
包厢已满这趟红眼儿航班
飞过喜马拉雅山又白又长又宽

H A L F A 登机
B to da L to da U N T
H A L F A 出击
T H double E N D

原地起飞专治你的颈椎
树根子煮的汤难喝也干杯
屋里没有暖气用干邑来暖胃
我们太燥蔫的根本不敢体会
设备在敲老学校在支招儿
从头到脚震动每个细胞
抱上一筐黑胶燃料充分燃烧
升倍儿他妈高环境云雾缭绕
总有一股神秘力量让我盘旋不落
虽然机舱有点破声效最高规格
还不没明白事儿的不嫌多有一个算一个
我领导的风格可以答疑解惑
dirty moss jinsfake sick natural doc
我们仨个一直都把这条航线霸着
抬头好好看看你上面儿的这些BUG
落地时候滚远点儿别被压着

H A L F A 登机
B to da L to da U N T
H A L F A 出击

dirty moss reconnect fade em all
Dirty Moss re-establishes their presence and disregards others who try to imitate them

你也能感觉的到所以fake fuck off
You can also sense it, so stop pretending and leave

停不了 烈酒就着药神魂颠倒
Can't stop, getting intoxicated with drugs and alcohol

节奏依旧粗糙麦克风早已出鞘
The rhythm remains rough, microphone is already in hand

我们方式简单也清楚你的算盘
Our method is simple, we understand what you're planning

聊天儿爱装社会只好祝你平安
If you only talk and pretend to be a part of society, we can only wish you the best of luck

冷眼旁观废物点心蹦的那么欢
Watching idiots dance with joy, meanwhile we keep our cool

尊重有实力的其他去你妈我不惯
I can't stand respecting others just because they have power

谁正走起来他妈给我都起开
Whoever is walking in the right direction, move out of my way

管你丫是几几拍北京nigga 五五开
I don't care what rhythm you have, I'm from Beijing, and I'm ahead of the game

we smoke my life 没琢磨 该不该
We smoke and live without thinking about whether it's right or not

真不听你犯傻逼Boom biddy bye bye
I really don't want to listen to your stupidity, so boom biddy bye bye

快结束的根儿再一次烫了嘴唇儿
As it's about to end, my lips are burning again

betas勾着魂儿发动嘴巴里的齿轮儿
Betas hook onto my soul, activating the gears in my mouth

包厢已满这趟红眼儿航班
The cabin is full on this red-eye flight

飞过喜马拉雅山又白又长又宽
Flying over the Himalayas, wide and long and white

H A L F A 登机
Half A, boarding

B to da L to da U N T
B to the L to the UNT

H A L F A 出击
Half A, heading out

T H double E N D
The end

原地起飞专治你的颈椎
Taking off in place, fixing your neck

树根子煮的汤难喝也干杯
Drinking tree root soup, even if it doesn't taste good

屋里没有暖气用干邑来暖胃
No heating in the house, warming the stomach with brandy

我们太燥蔫的根本不敢体会
We are too restless to even experience it

设备在敲老学校在支招儿
The equipment is banging, the old school is lending a hand

从头到脚震动每个细胞
Shaking every cell from head to toe

抱上一筐黑胶燃料充分燃烧
Holding a basket of vinyl fuel, burning it to the fullest

升倍儿他妈高环境云雾缭绕
Rising double high, surrounded by clouds and fog

总有一股神秘力量让我盘旋不落
There's always a mysterious force keeping me hovering without falling

虽然机舱有点破声效最高规格
Although the cabin is a bit messed up, the sound effects are top-notch

还不没明白事儿的不嫌多有一个算一个
Even those who don't understand should try, because one more is never too many

我领导的风格可以答疑解惑
My leadership style can answer your questions

dirty moss jinsfake sick natural doc
Dirty Moss, Jinsfake, Sick Natural, Doc

我们仨个一直都把这条航线霸着
The three of us have been dominating this flight route

抬头好好看看你上面儿的这些BUG
Look up and see the bugs above you

落地时候滚远点儿别被压着
When you land, roll away so you won't get crushed
