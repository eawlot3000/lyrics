距离

克服的距离 制造的距离
看似安全的距离 实际危险的距离
你看到的距离 我感受的距离
正在变化的距离 始终保持的距离

每个人的身边最近的就是距离
世间万物都存在着互相牵引的关系
月亮追逐太阳反射同一种光
不一样的角度就能产生不同的形状
行驶在路上需要保持车距
面对面的站着交流过滤信息传递
回避不着急的问题坏的距离堆积
都差不多就不应该只有个体
借助声音可以判断远近
我们通过比较衡量成就的高低
定义从厘米到公里
谁能精确测量从意识到身体
为了保护欲望有人封闭秘密
为了实现愿望有人努力维持联系
当我受够了城市中被侵蚀的空间
带上武器来到山里修自己的神仙

克服的距离 制造的距离
看似安全的距离 实际危险的距离
你看到的距离 我感受的距离
正在变化的距离 始终保持的距离

于是我发现新的距离来到身边
曾经的远在天边现如今近在眼前
视觉只是一方面因时而生的细节
体会到的感觉别吝啬感谢
can i kick it yes you can
一个loop循环唱盘走了几转
can u dig it yes we can
10公分的长度自由切换真的说不完
距离敬畏极限距离是条直线
距离我回归的时间我没有办法预言
距离清晰可见距离忽隐忽现
距离下一次的文明还有多少年
与危险擦肩而过之后幸运还有几次
失去的机会能不能有下一次
获得经验可以节省走我们弯路的距离
这一点点的优势消除距离聚集

克服的距离 制造的距离
看似安全的距离 实际危险的距离
你看到的看到的距离 我感受的距离
正在变化的距离 始终保持的距离
