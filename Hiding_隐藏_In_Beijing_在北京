lyrics to the song (my translation):

In Beijing/We walk on Chang'an Street 
In Beijing/There are many beautiful girls 
In Beijing/We worship Buddha in the Yonghe Temple 
In Beijing/We visit your Hutong
In Beijing/We learn history in the Palace Museum 
In Beijing/We bought a T-shirt in Xidan Mall 
In Beijing/Tian'anmen Square is very large 
In Beijing/There are many things you don't know
 
I live in Dongzhimen/They live on Xueyuan Rd. 
We have been to all those places/Thus the Hiding is very familiar with Beijing 
There are many colleges and computer shops in Haidian District  
There are many foreigners and CD shops in Wudaokou
At night we can go to Houhai and Sanlitun for a few drinks  
KTV is everywhere seen/There are some disco-bars around Beijing Workers' Gymnasium
There are other things to do besides dancing, drinking and gossiping 
You will surely still be flying high waking up the next morning 
The taxi is charged at 1.2 yuan or 1.6 yuan per kilometer 
The traffic is okay despite occasional congestion 
It's needless to mention those restaurants, the roast duck and the fried noodle with soy bean paste 
Oh my God there are so many hot-pot restaurants along Gui Street 
In the moring we can go to the Fragrance Hill to get in touch with nature 
Don't forget to drop by the Summer Palace when you return from there 
I have a friend who is studying at Beijing University and a girlfriend at Tsinghua 
On Chengfu Rd. there is an LRT running towards downtown 
In Beijing/The Olympics Games will be held in 2008 
In Beijing/The city is becoming more and more beautiful 
In Beijing/There are lakes and rivers 
In Beijing/Most people ride on bicycles 
In Beijing/There is the Chinese Great Wall 
In Beijing/It's really cold in winter 
In Beijing/There is the Chinese War Heros' Memorial 
In Beijing/Now you know

You buy mobile phones in Xizhimen and clothes near the Zoo 
You can easily lose your way in the West Railway Station 
From Jishuitan to Gulou and eastward from Andingmen 
You buy second-hand electric appliances/The Fifth Ring Road will be open to traffic soon 
It reaches out many limbs eastward and westward which always confuse my mind 
Embassies gather in Chaoyang District/Trees line up the streets there 
The business center is east to Jianguomen 
We live close to each other in Chinese courtyard houses
Trains pull in and out at the Beijing Railway Station/Visitors to the city stay in hotel rooms near the station for the night 
Buses go on highway from the Long-distance Bus Station
Wangfujing is very clean/The Malls at Oriental Plaza are there
The Art Museum is very quiet/In Beihai Park there is the Nine-Dragon Wall 
There are many poor in the Southern City/But the district is developing fast  
If you like to learn then go to the History Museum
You go all the way eastward from Qianmen to Zhongnanhai 

On behalf of Beijing, the Hiding hopes that all of you will visit the city often
In Beijing/We walk on Chang'an Street 
In Beijing/There are many beautiful girls 
In Beijing/We worship Buddha in the Yonghe Temple 
In Beijing/We visit your Hutong 
In Beijing/We learn history in the Palace Museum 
In Beijing/We bought a T-shirt in Xidan Mall 
In Beijing/Tian'anmen Square is very large 
In Beijing/There are many things you don't know 
In Beijing/The Olympic Games will be held in 2008 
In Beijing/The city is becoming more and more beautiful 
In Beijing/There are lakes and rivers 
In Beijing/Most people ride on bicycles 
In Beijing/There is the Chinese Great Wall 
In Beijing/It's really cold in winter 
In Beijing/There is the Chinese War Heroes' Memorial 
In Beijing/Now you know
