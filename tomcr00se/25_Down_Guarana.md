# 25 Down Guarana


### someone should explain my shit on rapgenius so i can understand it
### 
### ****
### 
### my goon says you can go on
### and we'll take this off ice, back to my office
### plus bonus, these girls wanna bone us
### though they just told us
### mining guild scams are off the menu
### you wouldn't continue, to con tin you
### hiding with your laptop, in a bag of groceries
### ingots in sacks, hoping thats said jokingly
### leaving me to hashtag wait and hope and see
### behind 7 proxies, you ran all locally
### and i know it's not your scene
### but party vans are not the parties that you see on your screen
### old school, kick it back to command.com
### when you still believed you one day might not live with your mom
### on your apple ii e, typing peek and poke
### when you first ixquicked for deep and throat
### john mccain, please let me beat the hope
### marketing campaign, scribbled with pen stains
### gone off that cocaine, crashing that fast train, in spain
### and watching when the fire sparks
### i was ethereal before i was a wireshark
###

### 有人应该在rapgenius上解释我的歌词，这样我才能理解它
### 
### ****
### 
### 我的伙计说你可以继续
### 我们会把这件事从冰上拿下，回到我的办公室
### 加上奖金，这些女孩想和我们一起
### 虽然她们刚刚告诉我们
### 矿业公会的骗局不再是选项
### 你不会继续，去骗 tin you
### 带着你的笔记本电脑，藏在一袋杂货里
### 希望那些装满锭的袋子只是开玩笑的
### 让我不得不用hashtag等待、希望和观望
### 通过7个代理，你在本地运行
### 我知道这不是你的场景
### 但派对车并不是你在屏幕上看到的那种派对
### 老派，回到command.com
### 当你还相信有一天你可能不会和你妈妈住在一起
### 在你的苹果ii e上，输入peek和poke
### 当你第一次使用ixquick搜索deep和throat
### 约翰·麦凯恩，请让我击败希望
### 营销活动，涂满墨迹
### 吸了可卡因，撞上西班牙的快车
### 看着火花四溅
### 在我成为Wireshark之前，我就是虚无的

### The overall theme and meaning of this song seem to be a complex blend of introspection, technology, and life experiences. The lyrics reflect a journey through different stages of life, contrasting past innocence with current realities, and exploring themes of ambition, disillusionment, and the fast-paced nature of modern life. The references to technology, such as "behind 7 proxies" and "Wireshark," suggest a deep engagement with the digital world, while personal reflections reveal a sense of nostalgia and a questioning attitude towards the changes brought by time and experience. The song seems to be about understanding and coming to terms with one's evolution, both personally and in relation to the technological world.
