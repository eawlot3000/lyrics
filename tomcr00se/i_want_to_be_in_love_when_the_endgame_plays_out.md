## the lyrics:
----
### It is the crisp, chilly night after a child's first Christmas.
### Barren streets save for a small crowd gathered outside a boutique electronics store.
### Listening to the man on the screen deliver a soliloquy about how bad it is going to get, interspersed with advertisements for Snuggies, Coco, and Geico.
### As the first flakes fall, we embrace in a Walgreens parking lot, armed with only our persons and tattered tech company hoodies.
### And with you pressed up against me, my ever-present companion, the racing inner monologue, gives way to the calm control of coming up on Adderall and realizing we are in a city of millions where nobody knows us, and we can just disappear and blend into the ether like radio waves and no one will give us a second thought.
### We make our way into a coffee shop where we huddle together around a pumpkin spice latte, not knowing how much longer this is all going to last, but in this moment not really caring.
### We think, therefore we are, and no one is omnipotent yet, so let's vanish into the cracks of sidewalks, drink from the Hudson River, and eat the remnants of a civilization where people would continue to stare at their phones while the hydrogen bombs detonate above them and the sky is blacked out so they download a flashlight app and make a dull-witted comment about how Obama should fix the sun on Facebook.
### We as people weren't built for this world.
### Why did we have to play by its arbitrary rules?
### Can I get a show of hands of people who still think the Industrial Revolution was a good idea?
### We've dug ourselves into a hole, and instead of trying to push the dirt back in it, we build dump trucks to cart it away, excavators to dig it deeper, drills to get through the bedrock, and lasers to ablate the diamond while we run ad campaigns to push the shiny rocks on soon-to-be-brides' fingers.
### Is it okay that we built a society where 13% of people are on antidepressants?
### Maybe it's time to rethink the hole.
### Sure, the hole had your smartphone and flush toilets in it, but it also had heroin and Twitter and drones and nuclear missiles, and we're digging more frantically than ever, and nobody is smart enough to know it lies even a little further down.
### Never mind if we finally break through to the other side where the world is so upside down that we'll literally have to lose ourselves to live in it, so maybe we should just stop fucking digging it!
### But the unions will uproar, and without the hole, what would society do all day?
### And there would always be some kid who thinks the hole is the greatest thing ever and sneaks down with a shovel at night just to move a little bit more dirt out of the way and enlists his friends to carry pails of it away, and the dirt is far too scattered to ever fill the hole back up anyway, so why should we even try?
### Let's just sit and sip our joint latte, and when it's done, step out into the night and hold each other as wallflowers with the storm rolling in as people hustle and bustle by all looking like they are going somewhere, and if anyone bothered to notice us, we'd be the freaks for just standing there.

## chinese translation:

这是一个孩子第一个圣诞节后的清冷夜晚。
街道空荡荡的，只有一小群人聚集在一家精品电子商店外。
听着屏幕上的人独白着即将到来的糟糕时刻，间或播放着Snuggies、Coco和Geico的广告。
当第一片雪花落下，我们在Walgreens停车场拥抱，身上只有破旧的科技公司连帽衫。
你贴在我身边，我那一直存在的内心独白，被服用Adderall后的冷静所取代，意识到我们在一个数百万人口的城市里，没有人认识我们，我们可以像无线电波一样消失在空气中，没有人会多看我们一眼。
我们走进一家咖啡店，围着一杯南瓜香料拿铁，彼此依偎，不知道这一切还能持续多久，但此刻我们并不在意。
我们思考，所以我们存在，还没有人是全知全能的，所以让我们消失在人行道的裂缝中，从哈德逊河中饮水，吃着文明的残渣，而人们在氢弹在他们头顶爆炸时依然盯着手机，当天空变黑时，他们下载手电筒应用，并在Facebook上发表愚蠢的评论，说奥巴马应该修复太阳。
我们这些人类并不适合这个世界。
为什么我们必须遵循它的任意规则？
有谁还认为工业革命是个好主意吗？
我们把自己挖进了一个坑里，而不是试图把土填回去，我们建造卡车把土运走，挖掘机把坑挖得更深，钻机钻穿基岩，激光器烧蚀钻石，同时我们进行广告活动，把闪亮的石头推销给即将成为新娘的手指上。
我们建立了一个13%的人在使用抗抑郁药的社会，这合适吗？
也许是时候重新考虑这个坑了。
当然，这个坑里有你的智能手机和抽水马桶，但它也有海洛因、Twitter、无人机和核导弹，我们比以往任何时候都更疯狂地挖掘，没有人足够聪明，知道再往下一点会有什么。
不用担心，如果我们最终打通到另一边，世界会颠倒过来，我们将不得不失去自己才能在其中生存，所以也许我们应该停止继续挖这个坑！
但工会会暴动，没有这个坑，社会整天会做什么？
总会有一些孩子认为这个坑是最棒的东西，夜里偷偷拿着铲子下来，只是为了再挖出一点点土，并召集他的朋友们把土运走，而这些土已经散得太远，永远也无法重新填满这个坑，那么我们为什么还要尝试呢？
让我们只坐着，喝完我们的联合拿铁，然后走进夜色，像墙花一样拥抱彼此，暴风雨滚滚而来，人们匆匆走过，看起来都在赶往某个地方，如果有人注意到我们，我们只因为站在那里就会被视为怪人。
