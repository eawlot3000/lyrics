隐藏 (yǐncáng or Yin Tsang or Yin Ts'ang, sometimes abbreviated YT which means "Hidden") are a Beijing based hip-hop group formed in 2000 by Chinese rapper 王波 (Wang Bo) (AKA MC Webber) and American 郑孑 (Zhang Jie) (AKA Foenix XIV). In 2001 they were joined by a Canadian-born Chinese, 马克 (Mark) (AKA Sbazzo) and another American, Heff (贺忠 He Zhong). They released their first CD, 为人民服务 (For the People) in 2003 and scored a hit with 在北京 (Welcome to Beijing), which features humorous lyrics about the city.

Later, Chen Mingyu, who was featured as a singer on one track of their debut CD, joined as a full member, along with Young Kin (AKA Kinetic Raw). They are one of the most acclaimed hip-hop crews in China. Their second album, 花天酒地 (huā tiān jiǔ dì / Fast Lane) came out in 2007.
